    <description><![CDATA[Nixpacks takes a source directory and produces an OCI compliant image that can be deployed anywhere. The project
      was started by the Railway team as an alternative to Buildpacks and attempts to address a lot of the shortcomings
      and issues that occurred when deploying thousands of user apps to the Railway platform. The biggest change is that
      system and language dependencies are pulled from the Nix ecosystem, which provides a bunch of benefits.
